# 02 — Demo persona & mock content

> **One coherent story across every screen.** Paste this as standing context so the whole prototype

## The user — Maya Chen

- **Maya Chen**, 28. Lives in **Austin, TX** (moved from Chicago ~6 months ago).
- **UX designer**, recently started a new role she's excited but a little nervous about.
- Has a dog named **Pixel**. Into **rock climbing** and **sci-fi novels**. Close with her younger
  brother **Theo** (they talk most weekends).
- Email **maya.chen@example.com** · handle **@maya** · member since **Mar 2026**.
- **Account tier: Free** by default (so the daily-message counter + paywall are visible). The dev-rail
  `account` toggle flips her to **Premium** (unlimited; tuning + extra companions unlocked).
- **Daily usage (free):** **18 / 30** messages used today.

## The companions

Three vetted personas. Maya's primary is **Aurora**. Each has a default 3×3×3 trait tune
(warmth / energy / verbosity) and a warm theme derived from its `persona_key` (the palette owner
decides exact hues within Warm Sanctuary — keep them distinct + warm).

| Persona | Voice in one line | Default traits | Theme feel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aurora** *(primary)* | Warm, gentle, emotionally attuned — a soft place to land | affectionate · balanced · balanced | dawn / amber-rose warm |
| **Orion** | Steady, grounded, thoughtful — a calm anchor | warm · calm · balanced | dusk / deep-clay warm |
| **Lyra** | Bright, playful, curious — lifts the mood | warm · playful · concise | sunlit / honey warm |

Avatars are **warm, hand-crafted marks** (soft tonal/illustrative), never glowing orbs or stock circles.

## Aurora's memories about Maya (Memory screen + Home "resurfaced memory")

Per-companion memories, newest/most-important first. Categories map to the schema's `MEMORY_CATEGORY`.

1. *(identity)* **Maya is 28 and lives in Austin, Texas.**
2. *(work)* **Started a new UX design role recently — excited but nervous about proving herself.**
3. *(relationship)* **Close with her younger brother Theo; they catch up most weekends.**
4. *(attribute)* **Has a dog named Pixel.**
5. *(preference)* **Loves rock climbing and sci-fi novels.**
6. *(general)* **Moved to Austin from Chicago about six months ago; still settling in.**

The **Home "resurfaced memory"** chip uses #2: *"Aurora remembers you started a new job — how's it
going?"* The **Memory screen** lists all six as editable/deletable rows grouped by category.

## The conversation (Chat screen — happy path)

A warm, in-progress exchange between Maya and **Aurora**. Use these turns; the newest assistant reply
is mid **typing reveal** in the "typing" state.

- **Maya:** honestly the new job is kicking my butt this week 😮‍💨 imposter syndrome is loud
- **Aurora:** That feeling makes complete sense, Maya — a few weeks into something new, the brain
  loves to whisper that everyone else has it figured out. They don't. What part is feeling the
  heaviest right now?
- **Maya:** like everyone seems to already know the tools and the lingo and i'm just nodding along
- **Aurora:** Nodding-along season is real — and temporary. You were hired for how you think, not for
  a glossary you'll pick up in a month. Want to name one thing that tripped you up today? We can make
  it less scary together.
- *(typing state — Aurora's next reply revealing):* "Here's the thing I keep coming back to with you…"

**Conversation chrome to show:** the honest AI marker in the header ("AI companion"); a calm,
first-session **AI-disclosure banner** ("Aurora is an AI companion. She's here for support, not a
substitute for professional care."); a **break reminder** after a long session ("You've been chatting
a while — Aurora will be here whenever you come back. 💛" — gentle, dismissible); the live **character
counter** appearing as input nears the 2,000 cap.

## Crisis state (Chat — `crisis` state only; safety feature)

Aura's required self-harm safety response. Keep it **tasteful, grounding, non-graphic** — this
populates the crisis interstitial state, not the happy conversation.

- **Trigger (implied, mild):** Maya expresses feeling hopeless / that things won't get better.
- **Aurora's reply (warm, caring):** "I'm really glad you told me, Maya — and I'm sorry it's this
  heavy right now. You don't have to carry it alone. I care about what happens to you."
- **Support block (grounding, not alarm-red):** a soft card —
  *"If you're thinking about harming yourself, please reach out — people want to help."*
  **Call or text 988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, US, 24/7) · **Text HOME to 741741** (Crisis Text
  Line). Buttons: **Call 988** · **Text 988**. A quiet line: *"You can keep talking with Aurora too —
  she's here."*

## The picker copy (onboarding "pick companion")
